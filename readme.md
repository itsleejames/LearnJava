### Question 2(a) [12 Marks]

Tax is charged as a percentage of your income. The percentage that you pay depends on the amount of your income. The first part of your income, up to a certain amount, is taxed at 20%.

The standard rate cut-off point for a single person is €35,300 and is taxed at the standard rate, (20%)

The remainder of your income is taxed at the *higher rate of tax*, 40% in 2019.

A single taxpayer who earns €40,000 a year will have their tax calculated as follows:

The standard rate band for a single taxpayer is €35,300.

This means that the first €35,300 is taxed at the standard rate of tax, 20%, and the remainder (€4,700) is taxed at the higher rate of tax, 40%.

| Calculation    | Amount |
|:---------------|-------:|
| €35,300 x 20%  | €7,060 |
| €4,700 x 40%   | €1,880 |
| Total          | €8,940 |
